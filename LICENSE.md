The license grants similar rights to the BSD, MIT, UoI/NCSA and Apache licenses – licenses allowing the software to be made proprietary – but was written to correct perceived problems with those licenses, the AFL:

makes clear what software is being licensed by including a statement following the software's copyright notice;
includes a complete copyright grant to the software;
contains a complete patent grant to the software;
makes clear that no trademark rights are granted to the licensor's trademarks;
warrants that the licensor either owns the copyright or is distributing the software under a license;
is itself copyrighted, with the right granted to copy and distribute without modification.
